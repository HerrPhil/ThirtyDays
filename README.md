# ThirtyDays

## Retrospective

I finished the elective at the end of the beautiful app pathway.

I applied the AnimatedVisibility that was introduced in the Superheroes solution code.

Even with the DampingRatioLowBouncy, the amination of list items in the LazyColumn are easy to see.

I like the effect.

I think the pathway code was suggesting to put the onClick expand logic on the image.

I stuck with the icon button expand more/less.

I learned that there is a maximum size limit to Image resources.

On my first iteration, I sourced some nice, free motorcycle images from the intertubes.

However, these images were 1 MB or more. This threw an error.

I reverted to following the subtle guidance of the pathway projects.

Find images that are a few kilobytes in file size and dimensions of 72 x 72.

That fixed the Image rendering bug.

I discovered that the preview is excellent at showing the list item composable.

However, for the preview of the list, it only renders all the sub-composables in interactive mode.
